> Simple turn based game written in React-Native. 

## Download Apk

The apk file can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pqBEw9p-VhJTd6OWMQi8k5ktRBrxMcTU?usp=sharing)

## Install 

The App was developed on a windows machine, hence the iOs compatibility was not tested. That said in theory it should run on iOs and Mac as well. 

If you wish to run the app locally, head to react native page and setup your environment  https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

After that install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
#### you need two terminal to run the app:
First start the node server
```bash
npx react-native start
```
and then 
```
npx react-native run-android
```

>there are different ways of running a react native app, but I suggest to follow the documentation and running the app on an emulator or you device.

## Test
For testing the components run 
```
npm run test
```
> Note: Due to time limitation, there are not many test scenario.
